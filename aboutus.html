    <p>
        That Oldies Shop brings old time classic music from three different era's for old timers and younger generation to enjoy. <br/>
        We wanted to bring back the old school to the new school and have others enjoy the music there parents/ grandparents enjoeyd when they were young. <br/>
        Not just record players we also have cassette players as well as cassette tapes. <br/>
        Cherishing the oldies and appreciating the impact that they have on music today, in my opnion bring generations together to enjoy music.
